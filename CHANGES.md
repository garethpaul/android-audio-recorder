# Changes

## 2026-06-08

- Added `make check` as the root wrapper for recorder source, lint, test, and
  debug build verification.
- Added a repository changelog and expanded the documented Android verification
  gate to include lint, tests, and debug assembly.
- Cleaned Android lint findings by removing unused starter resources, moving
  bitmap assets to `drawable-nodpi`, documenting the nodpi lint baseline, and
  adding button accessibility labels.
- Moved the recorder background color into the app theme to avoid root-layout
  overdraw.
- Added recorder/player cleanup contracts so failed media prepare/start/stop
  paths release resources predictably.
